MATLAB and Python codes of RR-MCA are given, as well as their corresponding examples.

The tablet dataset is a publicly available dataset, which can be downloaded from http://www.eigenvector.com/data/tablets/index.html.
Here, the tablet dataset in the examples has been pretreated, including outlier elimination, wavelength region selection and 
data split. The details of the pretreatment can be found in the reference above.

The principles of RR-MCA can be found in the reference above.
